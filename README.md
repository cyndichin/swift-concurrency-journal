# Swift Concurrency Journal

## ⚠️ Repo Under Construction ⚠️ 

A personal log of what I learn about Swift Concurrency — quick TILs, gotchas, and small runnable examples.

## How this repo is organized
- `journal/` — dated notes (e.g., `journal/category/2025-09-04-concurrency.md`)
- `snippets/` — tiny, focused code samples 
- `templates/` — note templates
- `resources/` — links to talks, docs, posts

## Conventions
- **One idea per note.** Keep it short.
- **Name** notes `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`.
- **Tag** with `#actor`, `#asyncawait`, `#cancellation`, etc.
- **Link related notes** with relative links.

## Add a new note
1. Copy a template:
   - Quick note: `templates/quick-note.md` → quick learnings <10 minutes.
   - Deep dive: `templates/deep-dive.md` → longer form.
2. Save under `journal/category/`.
3. If you made a sample, drop it in `snippets/` and reference it from the note.
